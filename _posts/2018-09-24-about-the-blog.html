About one year ago, I built a blog using Hexo and Github Pages, which provides a pretty convenient way of building a personal blog. However, I was so busy that I didn't post anything on the site. Just at that time, I came across the amazing editor Emacs and gradually found that it is much fabulous than I ever thought. What followed was my curiosity and the strong desire to learn Emacs more in detail. So why not build a personal blog with Emacs and Org-mode? I fork the beautiful Jekyll to build up my own blog to write whatever I want. I hope I can finally develop the good habit of making records. Let me stick to it!
