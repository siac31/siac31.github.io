The first thing after I set out to experience "Linux" operating system is installing "Emacs". Since I first stepped into the domain of "Emacs", I've then always been roaming in the intricate (definitely for me) forest of "GNU". It"s always tough when you start to embrace brand new things, but things will get better if you stick to it for a while. (I wouldn't say it's easy for me now, but I do switch the new stuff from devils to servants to some extent)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first thing you gotta do after you install Emacs is always configurating your initial files. Emacs can always satisify different requirements from different people. That's the magic of Emacs, and everyone has customited initial file for diverse purposes of use.</li>

<li>Then I started to write python, latex, and org files with Emacs.</li>

<li>I used to write latex file directly, but after I was aware of the existence of Org, I'm kind of excited and explore the world of org. Then I use Org, Emacs and GithubPages to build this personal blog. I use Org to write down notes which can be exported to latex, pdf, html files. There are still lots of cool things can be done with Org, but just a tip of the iceberg of Org can cheer you up.</li>

<li>As I said, the initial files are what you customize your Emacs, they are by the way light-weighted. So I always upload my initial files to the servers of my university. So that I can use the familiar Emacs at PC-Pool at Uni. That's great. I don't have to cary my computer.</li>
